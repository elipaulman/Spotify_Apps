# Spotify_Apps

Contains two Spotify extensions using an app in the Spotify API. 

The discover weekly app creates a copy of your current discover weekly playlist 
and saves it as a new playlist with the date that version of Discover Weekly was created.

The recommendation app uses listening data from the last hour to create a new playlist of recommended songs. This
allows you to get new, up to date songs with your current mood and feelings.
