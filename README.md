Spotify Extensions
This repository includes two Spotify extensions that utilize the Spotify API.

Discover Weekly App
The Discover Weekly app enables you to create a duplicate of your existing Discover Weekly playlist. It saves this copy as a new playlist, with the name indicating the date when that particular version of Discover Weekly was generated.

Recommendation App
The Recommendation app leverages your listening data from the past hour to curate a fresh playlist of recommended songs. By utilizing your current mood and feelings, this app ensures that you receive new and up-to-date tracks tailored to your preferences.
